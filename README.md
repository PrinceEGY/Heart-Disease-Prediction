# <div align="center">Heart Disease Prediction</div>  
  

Heart disease is the most common cause of death in the world, and approximately 1 in 5 people die from heart disease, this project can help predicting the probability of being affected by heart disease based on a well trained Machine Learning model  
  

## General Info  
- This project was created as a Mid-Project of Samsung Innovation Campus (SIC) training.
- The application construct is located in the app.py file. This file uses dataset from `Dataset folder` and the pretrained model from `Preprocessing & Modelling` folder
- **XGBoost** has got the best accuracy with **99%** accuracy on predicting people with no HeartDisease and **91%** accuracy on predicting people with Heart Disease
